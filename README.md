This tool is still in early development, but it should work just fine for now.<br />
However, there may be some bugs or glitches that need to be addressed, so please keep this in mind.<br />
Please report them to me if you encounter any problems.

## How to Use

To use this tool, simply copy the name of the player you're interested in from your local or chat window.<br />
The tool will automatically retrieve the player's information and display additional metrics in a tooltip.

### Instructions for using EveSquadron

You can use EveSquadron on all major platforms, including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.<br />

Once you've downloaded the tool, you can run it easily on Windows by double-clicking the EveSquadron.exe file.

To make it executable, run the first command. The second one will start the tool:

```

### How to manually compile/run the application with dotnet
